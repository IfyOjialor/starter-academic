I am an independent Statistical Consultant/Data Scientist. I love tackling new data science projects. I am mainly drawn to Data extraction/Web scraping projects. Among other things, I enjoy trading Foreign Exchange Currencies, Lifting weights, and traveling. I am trained as a Mathematician and Statistician.
